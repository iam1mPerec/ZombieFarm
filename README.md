# ZombieFarm
My first big c++ project
I was trying. out different patterns and learning different things. I wanted to try out what I can do and implement in a console cpp project. I've done a lot of mistakes and would implement it differently now, but I think it has a lot going for it.
Player can build a small city, gather resources as well as fight hordes of undead monstrers.
Units can be upgraded they have levels, stats, classes, equipment, consumables at their disposal to fight zombies with different abilities.
